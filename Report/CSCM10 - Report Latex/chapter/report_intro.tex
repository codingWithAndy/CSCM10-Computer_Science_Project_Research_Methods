\chapter{Introduction}
	\label{chap:intro}
	
	This report aims to research the concept of gamification. Exploring what it is, by exploring its background, as well as how gamification, is applied within education. As well as aiding fundamental teaching concepts, especially within a science context. With the aim of the findings creating a foundation for the author's masters dissertation. 
	
	\section{Motivations}
		\label{sec:intro_motivation} 
		
		Large documents can become cumbersome to work with and format consistently. Sensibly chosen aesthetic cues are important to help imply structure and can greatly aid the reader in understanding your work. The accompanying LaTeX template uses abstraction to hide the formatting from the author during content preparation, allowing for consistent styling to be applied automatically during document compilation. In this Google Docs theme it is the responsibility of the author to manually adhere to the styling laid out in this template.
	
	\subsection{Objective}
		\label{sec:intro_objective} 
		
		In this report, we explore what gamification is, what it consists of and how it can aid and reinforce the teaching and learning, while keeping the product engaging as well as incentivise the user to return. 
		
	\section{Overview}  
		\label{sec:intro_overview} 
		
		The remainder of chapter 1 outlines the document structure. This report contains chapter 2, which, researches into the background of gamification. This chapter also reflects on have gamification is used within a Science context. The chapter also looks at researching potential ways of applying gamification techniques to science concepts/ideas. An example this is through using potential appropriate user engagement and incentivisation techniques teaching key machine learning concepts. Also on the impact gamification has had within education and how it can aid teaching while reinforcing learning and attainment levels. Furthermore, lastly in chapter 3, we summarise the main contributions and main concepts into gamification.
