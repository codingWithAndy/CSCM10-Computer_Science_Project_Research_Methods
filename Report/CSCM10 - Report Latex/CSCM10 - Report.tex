		As part of the module for CSCM10, we need to create a report that explains a subcategory of our masters’masters’ dissertation. In this report, we will look at how gamification creates the desire to keep the user engaged as well as reinforcing any potential learning taking place, through motivation techniques and incentives.  
		
		We will, in this report, be exploring the background of gamification, as well as aspects like how the science of gamification works, and practices currently used. In this report, we will also reflect on how to take scientific ideas, for example, Machine Learning, and applying gamification practice to them. While also taking into account the additional aspect of integrating gamification within education and teaching.
